                <h4>Heyfood is a startup whose product is a food delivery and pickup service for the contintent of Africa (similar to Doordash, UberEats, and Grubhub in the United States). 
                    The company is based in Ibadan, Nigeria, and their target population consists of Millennials and Gen Z urban professionals in 
                    Africa's top 70 cities.

                <h4>
                    We sketched four unique versions of Heyfood's product as a mobile app. For each set of sketches, we chose to focus on three separate pages: 
                    Home, Search/Ordering, and Checkout. These pages are core to Heyfood's product and business model, so it was integral to sketch a wide variety of 
                    potential designs.

                <h4>We used the lo-fi prototype to help mock up a preliminary hi-fi prototype of Heyfood's product in Figma. The hi-fi prototype consists of interactive elements, a coordinated color scheme,
                    and a chosen typeface suited for the product and brand. After receiving feedback from our peers and TAs in a studio critique, we made changes to the prototype to
                    address their suggestions and comments. Finally, we arrived at the final iteration <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/DsgM32mCliKNCXyptgqzoF/Hi-Fi?node-id=106%3A107&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A3" target="_blank">here</a>.
