                <h4>Heyfood is a startup whose product is a food delivery and pickup service for the contintent of Africa (similar to Doordash, UberEats, and Grubhub in the United States). 
                    The company is based in Ibadan, Nigeria, and their target population consists of Millennials and Gen Z urban professionals in 
                    Africa's top 70 cities. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    We sketched four unique versions of Heyfood's product as a mobile app. For each set of sketches, we chose to focus on three separate pages: 
                    Home, Search/Ordering, and Checkout. These pages are core to Heyfood's product and business model, so it was integral to sketch a wide variety of 
                    potential designs.

                <h4>We used the lo-fi prototype to help mock up a preliminary hi-fi prototype of Heyfood's product in Figma. The hi-fi prototype consists of interactive elements, a coordinated color scheme,
                    and a chosen typeface suited for the product and brand. After receiving feedback from our peers and TAs in a studio critique, we made changes to the prototype to
                    address their suggestions and comments.

                <h4>We conducted user testing of our app with UserTesting.com, which is a website in which random participants iteracted with our design such that we could
                    receive more feedback about its usability. For a specific task for the user to do, we chose navigating from the home page to
                    the checkout page. We included two action steps and two questions about the page in the following order:

                    <li class="list">

                    <li class="list">
                        How clear are the purposes of the different buttons on the site? The options are: Very Unclear, Unclear, Somewhat Clear, Clear, and Very Clear

                <h4>
                    Based on the user testing results, we learned about how to improve the usability of our design and the clarity of our instructions. Our startup, Heyfood, mainly focuses on e-commerce and ordering 
                    food, thus the task we set for our users was to complete a transaction (by navigating to the checkout page). 
                    All three users met our expectations and were able to navigate through the app with little difficulty. They found each step of the process easy to understand (choosing a restaurant, 
                    placing an order and checking out) and many of them were able to identify what each symbol and button did. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    We also included a subtask, which asked the users to switch from delivery to pickup. Although all three users were able to complete the main task, they experienced difficulty completing our subtask. 
                    This may be a result of this function only existing on the home page, causing users extra time to figure out how to do this. Some of the users expressed frustration with that fact that you cannot 
                    change the order from delivery to pickup at the checkout page, but need to navigate all the way back to the home page to do this. We plan on adding this functionality due to these concerns.
